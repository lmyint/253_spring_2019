This is the class manual for Machine Learning (MATH 253) at Macalester College. The content here was made by [Leslie Myint](https://lmyint.github.io) and draws upon our class textbook, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/), and on [materials](https://ajohns24.github.io/253_Fall_18/index.html) prepared by [Alicia Johnson](https://ajohns24.github.io/).
